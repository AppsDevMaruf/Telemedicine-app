## Built With ðŸ› 

- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - First class and official programming language for Android
  development.
- [Coroutines Android](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines) - A coroutine is a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously. Coroutines were added to Kotlin in version 1.3 and are based on established concepts from other languages.
- [Dependency injection with Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) - Hilt provides a standard way to use DI in your application by providing containers for every Android class in your project and managing their lifecycles automatically. Hilt is built on top of the popular DI library Dagger to benefit from the compile-time correctness, runtime performance, scalability, and Android Studio support that Dagger provides. For more information, see Hilt and Dagger.
- [Paging](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/v3-overview) -The Paging library helps you load and display pages of data from a larger dataset from local storage or over network. This approach allows your app to use both network bandwidth and system resources more efficiently
- [Navigation component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started) - Navigation occurs between your app's destinationsâ€”that is, anywhere in your app to which users can navigate. These destinations are connected via actions.
  A navigation graph is a resource file that contains all of your destinations and actions. The graph represents all of your app's navigation path
- [Coil](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/) - An image loading library for Android backed by Kotlin Coroutines
- [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding) - The Data Binding Library is a support library that allows you to bind UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically.
- [Material Components for Android](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android) - Modular and customizable Material Design UI components for Android.
- [Paging 3 with room database] (https://genicsblog.com/gouravkhunger/pagination-in-android-room-database-using-the-paging-3-library) - The Paging 3 library, a part the new set of Android Jetpack libraries, provides a robust way of paginating large sets of data in Android whether it is loaded from a room database or from a network layer.
